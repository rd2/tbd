### Basics

This section goes over the _bare bones minimum_ of what's needed to run TBD as an OpenStudio Measure, including minimal OpenStudio model requirements, what additional inputs are needed, and finally how to actually run the measure.

Experienced OpenStudio users should feel comfortable jumping right in. Newcomers to OpenStudio are encouraged to first check out the [OpenStudio primer](./openstudio.html "An OpenStudio primer for TBD users") and/or official online documentation for [OpenStudio](https://openstudio.net "OpenStudio"), including the [OpenStudio Application](https://openstudiocoalition.org// "OpenStudio Application") - it'll help!

### OpenStudio model requirements

- 3D model consistency ...  
- boundary conditions  
- materials & multilayered constructions  

### Optional model requirements

- thermal zoning  
- heating/cooling _setpoints_  
- HVAC air loops  

### Where does one get psi data?

- TBD defaults  
- envelope details & specs  
- manufacturer data  
- [BETBG](https://www.bchydro.com/powersmart/business/programs/new-construction.html "Building Envelope Thermal Bridging Guide") & [thermalenvelope.ca](https://thermalenvelope.ca)  
- past research projects  
- codes and standards
