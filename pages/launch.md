### Launching

OpenStudio users typically first need to specify where downloaded _measures_ are stored on their workstation (_Preferences_ > _Change My Measures Directory_) - just download TBD in there (click on the _download_ links at the top of the page, or download from GitHub or [BCL](https://bcl.nrel.gov/dashboard "OpenStudio's Building Component Library") - search for "tbd" or "rd2"). Then in the _OpenStudio Application_, simply drag & drop TBD in the _Measures_ tab.

As with other OpenStudio measures, TBD does not modify (by default) the original OpenStudio model (e.g. new _derated_ constructions). OpenStudio instead makes a behind-the-scenes copy of the model, which is in turn modified by measures before simulation. Although the terminology may be at first confusing, leave the __Alter OpenStudio model__ option CHECKED for EnergyPlus simulations (see [menu options](./settings.html "TBD settings")). This checkbox option is really there for _Apply Measures Now_ cases, as detailed below. Once the __Default thermal bridge set__ is selected, save the model and run the simulation.

### Apply Measures Now

The original intent of an _Apply Measures Now_ feature in OpenStudio is to irreversibly alter a building model without the need to run an EnergyPlus simulation. For instance, the [KIVA](./kiva.html "KIVA support") options in TBD work best in _Apply Measures Now_ mode: best leave the __Alter OpenStudio model__ option CHECKED in such cases, while ideally relying on the default "(non thermal bridging)" set.

However, there are _Apply Measures Now_ situations where permanent changes to an OpenStudio model aren't warranted or desirable, in which case it becomes critical to UNCHECK the __Alter OpenStudio model__ option:

- __Iterative investigations__: Users may simply want to get a status report of how well they're managing thermal bridging in their projects. TBD provides the same user feedback (including errors & warnings) in either mode. Consult the [Reporting](./reports.html "What TBD reports back") section.

- __UA' reports__: Similarly, TBD can generate at any moment [UA'](./ua.html "UA' assessments") summaries (often admissible building energy code compliance paths). Same for [uprating](./ut.html "Uprating") features.

- __JSON output__: TBD users can generate a complete, detailed list of every _major_ thermal bridge in their OpenStudio model, which can be useful for automating cost estimation or simply for further [customization](./custom.html "TBD customization").

An example of an _Apply Measures Now_ setup:

![AMN Menu](../assets/images/AMN1.png "AMN Menu")

Here, _Apply Measures Now_ will generate a __UA'__ report (MD-formatted), as well as a _full_ __JSON__ output file - complete with all edges, uprated Uo factors for roofs, UA' summaries, logs, etc. Note that this performance _snapshot_ will NOT __alter__ the OpenStudio model - the first menu option here remains UNCHECKED. Clicking on `Apply Measure` ...

![AMN Results](../assets/images/AMN2.png "AMN Results")

If unsatisfied with the results (e.g., too costly to comply to NECB 2017 prescriptive roof requirements, wall detailing may need to be revised), then the user simply needs to `Back` out, tweak inputs again, then re-`Apply Measure`, reassess, and so on ... Once satisfied with a _winning_ combination of variables, press `Accept Changes`, then `save` the OpenStudio model to retrieve the newly-generated __UA'__ and __JSON__ files (see [Reporting](./reports.html "What TBD reports back") to locate saved files). Take note of the _winning_ combination of inputs - you'll likely need to reapply these for EnergyPlus simulations down the line.

__A word of caution__. Older versions of the _OpenStudio Application_ will NOT copy over such `.md` or `.json` files generated by _Apply Measures Now_ ... __if__ these files already exist in the model _files_ folder. If needed, simply rename or delete the existing files before opening the OpenStudio model.
