<p>By default, TBD presumes an OpenStudio model’s opaque surfaces (maybe in the hundreds) refer to one (or very few) common multilayered construction(s) that reflect <em>clear-field</em> design intent. TBD subsequently <em>derates</em> these multilayered constructions on a surface-per-surface basis for energy simulation purposes. So while each construction has a unique <em>clear-field</em> <strong>Uo</strong> factor, each surface has a unique <em>derated</em> <strong>Ut</strong> factor (once TBD is done).</p>

<p>Depending on the <em>extent</em> of thermal bridging (due to each surface’s edge lengths and <em>psi</em> factors), surface-specific <em>derating</em> can range from <em>barely noticeable</em> to <em>extensive</em> (e.g. &gt; 50%). One may start off with a single, common <em>clear-field</em> construction for all exterior wall surfaces, the latter will end up with sometimes radically different <strong>Ut</strong> factors.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Ut = Uo + ( ∑psi • L )/A + ( ∑khi • n )/A
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This presumption is consistent with typical building energy simulation workflows. Yet determining what should be the initial (common) construction <strong>Uo</strong> factor may not be straightforward. What happens when designers are unsure of what initial <em>clear-field</em> <strong>Uo</strong> factor they should start off with, given façade layouts and thermal bridging design choices? Is it economically wise to aim for much lower <strong>Uo</strong> factors, as a means to compensate for <em>major</em> thermal bridging?</p>

<p>In some cases, building professionals may even choose (or are required) to achieve a maximum, area-weighted average <strong>Ut</strong> for all exterior wall surfaces. It’s the case for prescriptive requirements of the Canadian NECB 2017 and 2020 editions, e.g. a final wall area-weighted average <strong>Ut</strong> of 0.210 W/m2.K (R27) for climate zone 7 (NECB 2017). Depending on the <em>extent</em> of thermal bridging, the initial <em>clear-field</em> <strong>Uo</strong> factor for that single, common construction may need to be 0.160 (or much, much lower).</p>

<p>So in addition to <em>derating</em> construction <strong>Uo</strong> factors (to final surface <strong>Ut</strong> factors) for energy simulation purposes, TBD offers designers the option to first autogenerate required <em>clear-field</em> <strong>Uo</strong> factors (a process called <em>uprating</em>) to meet a given target, by reordering the above equation.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Uo = Ut - ( ∑psi • L )/A + ( ∑khi • n )/A
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>Uprating</em> menu options (see <a href="./settings.html" title="TBD settings">Settings</a>), are paired together for <em>walls</em>, <em>roofs</em> and/or exposed <em>floors</em> (let’s make things easy here by limiting the discussion to walls). The default value assigned to the “Wall construction(s) to ‘uprate’” pull-down menu option is “NONE”, disabling any <em>uprating</em> calculations for walls. TBD nonetheless pre-scans an OpenStudio model to retrieve referenced wall constructions in order of prevalence - referenced constructions covering a larger area are listed higher up in the pull-down list. Users can either limit <em>uprating</em> calculations to one (1x) such referenced wall construction, or to “ALL wall constructions” in a building model. The latter is an all-encompassing solution, overriding previously set construction assignments (the most prevalent wall construction is nonetheless retained as the basis for subsequent <em>uprating</em> - and then <em>derating</em> - calculations). Users can also set the desired, area-weighted <strong>Ut</strong> factor for selected walls (default factors are those of the NECB 2017 for climate zone 7).</p>

<p>TBD will log (and flash on screen if using the OpenStudio Application) the calculated <em>clear-field</em> <strong>Uo</strong> factor required to achieve the desired area-weighted <strong>Ut</strong> for walls (see <a href="./reports.html" title="What TBD reports back">Reporting</a>).</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>An initial wall Uo of 0.162 W/m2•K is required to achieve an overall Ut of 0.210 W/m2•K for ALL wall constructions.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <em>uprating</em> calculations are similar to <a href="./ua.html" title="UA' assessments">UA’</a>  assessments, yet in reverse order. In any <em>UA</em>-type exercise (like the <em>uprating</em> calculations), a significantly weaker component will have a disproportionate effect vs its area (as summarized in the very first paragraph of this <a href="../index.html" title="Thermal Bridging &amp; Derating">guide</a>, “In a nutshell …”). For very efficient envelope designs (e.g. continuous outboard insulation, thermally-broken cladding clips, minimal fenestration, favourable façade aspect ratios), the degree of <em>uprating</em> may be quite reasonable. It may however be very challenging (and onerous) to meet such ambitious <strong>Ut</strong> targets when factoring-in weaker components (e.g., spandrels, poor detailing, lots of fenestration).</p>

<p>We strongly recommend to first investigate this feature while relying on <a href="./launch.html" title="Launching TBD as a process">Apply Measures Now</a> feedback (ideally UNCHECKing the <strong>Alter OpenStudio model</strong> option), to get a sense of how significant the <em>uprating</em> calculations may end up altering your initial designs. In some cases, EnergyPlus’ CTF convergence calculations may even fail with very thick (<em>uprated</em>) insulation layers !</p>
