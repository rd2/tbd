<h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>

<p>This section goes over the <em>bare bones minimum</em> of what’s needed to run TBD as an OpenStudio Measure, including minimal OpenStudio model requirements, what additional inputs are needed, and finally how to actually run the measure.</p>

<p>Experienced OpenStudio users should feel comfortable jumping right in. Newcomers to OpenStudio are encouraged to first check out the <a href="./openstudio.html" title="An OpenStudio primer for TBD users">OpenStudio primer</a> and/or official online documentation for <a href="https://openstudio.net" title="OpenStudio">OpenStudio</a>, including the <a href="https://openstudiocoalition.org//" title="OpenStudio Application">OpenStudio Application</a> - more than useful!</p>

<h3 id="context">Context</h3>

<p>OpenStudio construction details and geometry are required architectural inputs for TBD. <em>Complete</em> OpenStudio models also hold abstract variables like thermal zones and schedules, in addition to electrical loads, lighting and HVAC systems. TBD works fine with such <em>complete</em> models, yet is well capable of handling <em>partial</em> or <em>minimal</em> OpenStudio models.</p>

<p>Why? Let’s start by venturing that there’s more than one way to approach building energy modelling. One obvious scenario is to hire competent building energy modellers who take care of everything - they’re specialized and very good at what they do. Yet it has its drawbacks as a <em>centralized</em> solution. TBD works just as well within more <em>distributed</em> approaches, where specialists may contribute to the same collective energy model, yet at different stages of the design and on different parts of the model - ideally under supervisory versioning control (just like software development). Architectural professionals should be encouraged in updating and maintaining geometry and construction parameters (including thermal bridging) of an OpenStudio model throughout the design process. Same goes for lighting consultants, estimators, LCA assessors, etc.</p>

<p>In other cases, architects may simply wish to explore (e.g., via OpenStudio’s SketchUp plugin) whether their designs comply with certain envelope prescriptive targets, which can be efficiently ascertained using OpenStudio + TBD (and without running a single energy simulation). If they’re unsuccessful in achieving e.g., <a href="./ua.html" title="UA' assessments">UA’</a> trade-off targets, they can then hand off the model to lighting and HVAC modellers. For the latter, inheriting a complete <em>architectural</em> energy model can be a huge time saver. This fits in well with integrated design processes, while encouraging a healthy division of labour and fair distribution of professional liability. Let’s go over what TBD requires.</p>
