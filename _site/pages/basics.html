<h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>

<p>This section goes over the <em>bare bones minimum</em> of what’s needed to run TBD as an OpenStudio Measure, including minimal OpenStudio model requirements, what additional inputs are needed, and finally how to actually run the measure.</p>

<p>Experienced OpenStudio users should feel comfortable jumping right in. Newcomers to OpenStudio are encouraged to first check out the <a href="./openstudio.html" title="An OpenStudio primer for TBD users">OpenStudio primer</a> and/or official online documentation for <a href="https://openstudio.net" title="OpenStudio">OpenStudio</a>, including the <a href="https://openstudiocoalition.org//" title="OpenStudio Application">OpenStudio Application</a> - more than useful!</p>

<h3 id="context">Context</h3>

<p>OpenStudio construction details and geometry are required architectural inputs for TBD. <em>Complete</em> OpenStudio models also hold abstract variables like thermal zones and schedules, in addition to electrical loads, lighting and HVAC systems. TBD works fine with such <em>complete</em> models, yet is well capable of handling <em>partial</em> or <em>minimal</em> OpenStudio models.</p>

<p>Why? Let’s start by venturing that there’s more than one way to approach building energy modelling. One obvious scenario is to hire competent building energy modellers who take care of everything - they’re specialized and very good at what they do. Yet it has its drawbacks as a <em>centralized</em> solution. TBD works just as well within more <em>distributed</em> approaches, where specialists may contribute to the same collective energy model, yet at different stages of the design and on different parts of the model - ideally under supervisory versioning control (just like software development). Architectural professionals should be encouraged to update and maintain geometry and construction parameters (including thermal bridging) of an OpenStudio model throughout the design process. Same goes for lighting consultants, estimators, LCA assessors, etc.</p>

<p>In other cases, architects may simply wish to explore whether their designs comply with certain envelope prescriptive targets, which can be efficiently ascertained using OpenStudio &amp; TBD (and without running a single energy simulation). If they’re unsuccessful in achieving e.g., <a href="./ua.html" title="UA' assessments">UA’</a> trade-off targets, they can always hand off the model to lighting and HVAC modellers. For the latter, inheriting a complete <em>architectural</em> energy model can be a huge time saver. This fits in well with integrated design processes, while encouraging a healthy division of labour and fair distribution of professional liability. Let’s go over what TBD requires from a <em>minimal</em> OpenStudio model.</p>

<h3 id="minimal-model-requirements">Minimal model requirements</h3>

<p><strong>Fully enclosed geometry</strong>: OpenStudio (and to a large extent EnergyPlus) work much better in general when a building model is <em>geometrically enclosed</em> i.e., <em>air tight</em> (no gaps between surfaces). This also means no unintentional surface overlaps or loosely intersecting edges, windows properly <em>fitting</em> within the limits of their parent (or host) wall, etc. The example <a href="../index.html" title="Thermal Bridging &amp; Derating">warehouse</a> is a good visual of what this all means. It’s worth mentioning, as some third-party design software offer mixed results with <em>enclosed geometry</em> when auto-generating BIM-to-OSM models. TBD &amp; Topolys do have some built-in tolerances (25 mm), but they can only do their job if vertices, edges and surfaces are well connected. Note that <em>partial</em> OpenStudio models are not required to holds ALL building surfaces - just those that comprise the <em>building envelope</em>, as well as interior floor surfaces. If a building has cantilevered balconies for instance, it’s also a good idea to include those as shading surfaces.</p>

<p><strong>Materials &amp; constructions</strong>: Geometry is not enough. TBD must be able to retrieve referenced materials and multilayered constructions for all <em>envelope</em> surfaces. The easiest way is via <em>Default Construction Sets</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Boundary conditions</strong>: It’s important that the OpenStudio model reflects intended exposure to surrounding environmental conditions, including which surfaces face the exterior vs the interior, the ground, etc. TBD will only seek to <em>derate</em> outdoor-facing <em>envelope</em> walls, roofs and exposed floors. Windows, doors and skylights are never derated. Adiabatic and ground-facing (or KIVA foundation) surfaces are also never derated.</p>

<h3 id="optional-model-requirements">Optional model requirements</h3>

<p>TBD does require additional OpenStudio inputs in some circumstances. Unheated or uncooled spaces (like attics and crawlspaces) are considered <em>unconditioned</em>: their outdoor-facing surfaces aren’t part of the <em>building envelope</em>, and therefore not targeted by TBD. On the other hand, outdoor-facing surfaces of <em>indirectly-conditioned</em> spaces like plenums are considered part of the <em>envelope</em>, and therefore should be derated. Sections 2.3.2 to 2.3.4 <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-26917.pdf" title="90.1-2016 Performance Rating Method Reference Manual">here</a> provide a good overview of the question. Here’s the underlying logic that guides TBD in such cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>With <em>partial</em> OpenStudio models, TBD will seek to derate ALL outside-facing surfaces by positing that ALL spaces are <em>conditioned</em>, with <em>assumed</em> setpoints of ~21°C (heating) and ~24°C (cooling) à la BETBG. This is OK for most models (even those with plenums), yet not for those with attics or crawlspaces.</li>
  <li>If a <em>more complete</em> OpenStudio model has at least one space linked to a <em>thermal zone</em> having temperature setpoints, TBD will instead seek to only derate outdoor-facing surfaces of such <em>conditioned</em> spaces. TBD will safely ignore outdoor-facing surfaces in <em>unconditioned</em> spaces like attics and crawlspaces, yet unfortunately also those of plenums.</li>
  <li>With a <em>fairly complete</em> OpenStudio model (complete with thermal zones, temperature setpoints, and HVAC air loops), spaces will be tagged as indirectly-conditioned <em>plenums</em> if their linked thermal zones correspond to supply or return plenums as defined <a href="https://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/9-6/input-output-reference/group-air-path.html#airloophvacreturnplenum" title="EnergyPlus return air plenums">here</a> and <a href="https://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/9-6/input-output-reference/group-air-path.html#airloophvacsupplyplenum" title="EnergyPlus supply air plenums">here</a> (let’s call this <em>case A</em>).</li>
  <li>In absence of HVAC air loops, 2x other cases trigger a <em>plenum</em> tag: <em>case B</em> where the space is considered excluded from building’s total floor area (an OpenStudio variable), while having its thermal zone referencing an <em>inactive</em> thermostat (i.e., can’t extract valid setpoints); or <em>case C</em> where the <em>spacetype</em> name is simply set to “plenum” (case insensitive).</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, asking TBD to distinguish between <em>conditioned</em> vs <em>indirectly-conditioned</em> vs <em>unconditioned</em> spaces requires a combination of the following, depending on whether attics and/or crawlspaces are found in the OpenStudio model:</p>

<ul>
  <li>thermal zones</li>
  <li>heating/cooling setpoints</li>
  <li>HVAC air loops</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a <em>lot</em> to ask of most technically-inclined architects, as these are pretty specific HVAC items. There are OpenStudio user scripts that will auto-generate thermal zones from spaces (one-to-one), but it’s unlikely to match what the HVAC designer has in mind (and therefore often not a great idea). So with <em>unconditioned</em> spaces, better off asking the HVAC engineer/modeller to complete the setup.</p>
