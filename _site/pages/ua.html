          <h3 id="ua">UA’</h3>

<p>Many building energy codes offer traditional <em>prescriptive</em> paths, as well as simulation-based <em>performance</em> paths, as means to comply. <em>Trade-off</em> paths are intermediates, where compliance can be assessed for a particular sub-domain like building envelope or interior lighting.</p>

<p>Common trade-off solutions for building envelopes (at least in North America) are <em>UA</em> trade-offs, whereby one or more <em>non-compliant</em> envelope components (e.g. spandrel panels) can be compensated by one or more <em>improved</em> components (e.g. roof insulation). Traditionally, <em>UA</em> trade-offs are based on <em>total envelope heat loss</em> (in W/K), as supported by <a href="https://www.energycodes.gov/rescheck">REScheck</a>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>UA = ∑Uo•A
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>… where:</p>

<p><strong>Uo</strong> : <em>clear field</em> transmittance<br />
<strong>A</strong> : opaque surface area</p>

<p>If the total <em>UA</em> of a <em>proposed</em> envelope design is equal or inferior to the corresponding total <em>UA</em> of a <em>reference</em> (complying to prescriptive requirements), then the proposed design complies. This simplified approach is considered suitable for cold climates, as long as one operates within a well-defined scope:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UA is power-based (W), instantaneous</li>
  <li>time-delayed responses are not factored-in …</li>
  <li>so forget thermal mass, ground heat loss, solar, etc.</li>
  <li>fenestration U-values and areas are factored-in …</li>
  <li>yet differences in fenestration areas are not</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="major-thermal-bridging"><em>Major</em> thermal bridging</h3>

<p>Québec’s recent energy code (Section 3.3) expands on the concept by including <em>major</em> thermal bridges in the mix:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>UA' = ∑Uo•A + ∑psi•L + ∑khi•n
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>… where:</p>

<p><strong>psi</strong> : linear <em>edge</em> transmittance<br />
<strong>L</strong> : length of the <em>edge</em><br />
<strong>khi</strong> : e.g. column <em>point</em> transmittance<br />
<strong>n</strong> : number of similar columns</p>

<p>If the proposed total <em>UA’</em> is equal or inferior to the reference total <em>UA’</em>, then the proposed design complies.</p>

<h3 id="ua-menu-options">UA’ menu options</h3>

<p>TBD automatically processes what’s required (inputs) to carry out <em>UA’</em> assessments, as well as what’s often needed to demonstrate compliance (outputs) for code authorities. See TBD’s menu options under <a href="./basics.html" title="Basic TBD workflow">Basics</a>:</p>

<p><strong>UA’</strong>: checkbox enabling UA’ assessments<br />
<strong>UA’ reference</strong>: vs which prescriptive requirements?</p>

<p>The <strong>UA’ reference</strong> pull-down options correspond to TBD’s <strong>Default thermal bridge sets</strong>. If the “code (Quebec)” option is selected, then the reference prescriptive requirements include code-required <em>Uo</em>-values, in addition to code-required <em>psi</em> &amp; <em>khi</em> values (see <em>Where does one get psi data?</em> under <a href="./basics.html" title="Basic TBD workflow">Basics</a>). For all other <strong>UA’ references</strong>, only the <em>psi</em> &amp; <em>khi</em> values differ between <em>proposed</em> vs <em>reference</em> cases. It’s best to generate UA’ assessments under the <em>Apply Measures Now</em> mode, and UNCHECK the <strong>Alter OpenStudio model</strong> option.</p>

<p>Note that <em>UA’</em> calculations will factor in <a href="./ut.html" title="Uprating">uprated</a> assemblies, if selected.</p>

<h3 id="assessments">Assessments</h3>

<p>In addition to standard TBD feedback (see <a href="./reports.html" title="What TBD reports back">Reporting</a>), <em>UA’</em> assessments pop up in the <em>OpenStudio Application</em> runner messages, in the autogenerated <em>tbd.out.json</em> file, and in dedicated <em>UA’</em> reports (.md files, in both French and English):</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/UA.png" alt="UA Assessment" title="UA Assessment" /></p>

<p>The <strong>Summary</strong> is the key output to scrutinize. For both <em>heated</em> and <em>semi-heated</em> sections (if applicable), <em>UA’</em> totals (in W/K) give a sense of how close (or far) one is to reaching selected targets. Here (a hypothetical warehouse variant), the proposed design is considerably off the mark for both <em>heated</em> (+83.3%) and <em>semi-heated</em> (+113.7%) sections.</p>

<p>Results are further broken down into individual envelope components, such as walls, roofs, doors, windows, etc., and applicable thermal bridges (e.g. “trim” for all fenestration perimeters). This allows one to assess the relative impact of each item, where to concentrate future efforts, etc. For instance, the proposed doors in both <em>heated</em> and <em>semi-heated</em> sections are considerably off code requirements, yet their relative weight is limited to 5% to 10% of <em>UA’</em> totals.</p>

<p>TBD does not report on elements that are not part of the building envelope. In this warehouse example, the <em>heated</em> section is limited to a ground floor office - its ceiling connected to a storage space above. As the office ceiling is not a roof <em>per se</em> i.e., not part of the building envelope, TBD only reports on the <em>semi-heated</em> roof surfaces. Similarly, only thermal bridges identified by TBD in the OpenStudio model are part of the assessment e.g., no balconies here.</p>

<p>The <em>UA’</em> assessments are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">MD</a>-formatted, which can be rendered as HTML or even PDF, depending on the text editor or web browser.</p>
