          <h3 id="fenestration">Fenestration</h3>

<p>There are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to fenestration. Within the scope of this Guide, we consider as <em>fenestration</em> all <em>sub surfaces</em> (a technical term in OpenStudio) that are added to opaque, above-grade <em>host</em> surfaces like walls, roofs or exposed floors. This includes of course windows and skylights, but in this context also <em>unglazed</em> products like roof hatches and opaque doors. TBD is unconcerned with the nature of individual fenestration products <em>per se</em>, but rather the <strong>rough opening</strong> in the host surface required to harbour each fenestration product. Each <em>rough opening</em> typically requires additional framing along “<strong>sill</strong>”, “<strong>head</strong>” and “<strong>jamb</strong>” edges, with corresponding “<strong>fenestration</strong>” <em>psi</em> factors.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1A</strong> illustrates a residential entrance, complete with glazed door, (partial height) left and right sidelights, as well as a 3-section transom spanning the full width of the <em>rough opening</em>.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/entrance.png" alt="Entrance" title="Entrance" /></p>

<p>In OpenStudio, this 5-section entrance would be greatly simplified, and modelled as shown in <strong>Figure 1B</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Unless modelling a <em>tubular daylighting device</em> (<a href="https://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/22-2/input-output-reference/group-daylighting.html#daylightingdevicetubular" title="Tubular Daylighting Device">TDD</a>), a fenestrated surface must align with its host surface, i.e. they both must share the same 3D plane equation and the <em>sub surface</em> must <em>fit</em> within host surface boundaries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>TBD tags fenestration edges shared with host surfaces as either “<strong>head</strong>”, “<strong>sill</strong>” or “<strong>jamb</strong>” (depending on the situation, the door “sill” edge may later be overridden as a “grade” or “rimjoist” edge).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“head”, “sill” and “jamb” (as well as “grade” or “rimjoist”) edges generally constitute major thermal bridges, <em>derating</em> the host wall (never the <em>sub surface</em>). Compact fenestration (e.g. modest <em>sub surface</em> perimeter-to-area ratios) minimizes thermal bridging of the host wall construction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>TBD tags shared edges between <em>sub surfaces</em> (highlighted in blue) as (mild) “<strong>transitions</strong>” - by default, no <em>derating</em> results from such edges. It is presumed that any additional heat loss from fenestration framing would have been previously factored in the e.g. NFRC-rated fenestration U-factor.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="frame--dividers">Frame &amp; Dividers</h3>

<p>OpenStudio (and EnergyPlus) users can optionally associate <a href="https://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/22-2/input-output-reference/group-thermal-zone-description-geometry.html#windowpropertyframeanddivider" title="OpenStudio Frame and Dividers">frame &amp; divider</a> properties to most glazed <em>sub surfaces</em>. In a nutshell, this allows fenestration product frames (and dividers) to be modelled/simulated separately from glazing layers, in line with NFRC 100 rating procedures. This allows <em>inter alia</em> a more robust assessment of fenestration aspect ratios on energy performance (e.g. 1x larger fenestration product outperforming many narrower, smaller products). OpenStudio fenestration with <em>frame &amp; divider</em> properties requires modelling the glazing portion ONLY of each <em>sub surface</em> - not the <em>rough opening</em>, as illustrated in <strong>Figure 1C</strong> (same entrance design).</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/FD.png" alt="OpenStudio Frame &amp; Dividers" title="OpenStudio Frame &amp; Dividers" /></p>

<p>TBD recognizes added <em>frame and divider</em> properties in an OpenStudio model, and feeds Topolys <strong>extended</strong> <em>sub surface</em> vertices, as illustrated in <strong>Figure 1D</strong>. By relying on extended <em>sub surface</em> vertices, “head”, “sill” and “jamb” edges remain the same as in Figure 1B. This is also the case for “transition” edges shared between <em>sub surfaces</em> (highlighted in blue). Note that TBD will catch (and <a href="./reports.html" title="What TBD reports back">log</a>) invalid OpenStudio <em>frame &amp; divider</em> inputs that generate conflicts with either host surface boundaries or with other <em>sub surfaces</em>.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/FD2.png" alt="TBD Frame &amp; Dividers" title="TBD Frame &amp; Dividers" /></p>

<p><em>Frame &amp; divider</em> properties allow outside and inside <strong>reveals</strong> (i.e. <em>sub surface</em> setbacks with respect to exterior and/or interior surfaces), as illustrated in Figure 1A. In such cases, TBD considers “head”, “sill” and/or “jamb” <em>psi</em> factors to account for the effect of <em>reveals</em>.</p>

<h3 id="proximity-tolerances">Proximity tolerances</h3>

<p>Shared edges between <em>sub surfaces</em> at corners (vertical edges highlighted in blue in figures 2A, 2B and 3B) are also tagged by TBD as (mild) “transitions”. Again, additional heat loss resulting from <em>corner mullions</em> should preferably be factored in NFRC rating procedures, and thus shouldn’t <em>derate</em> host wall constructions.</p>

<p>By default, any <em>sub surface</em> edge defined within 10 mm of another <em>sub surface</em> edge, or near a host surface edge (e.g. a corner), is merged by Topolys as a single edge. TBD subsequently tags the shared edge as either a fenestration “jamb” or a “corner” edge, depending on the context. There is no difference between the application of Topolys’ built-in tolerances and what’s illustrated in <strong>Figure 2A</strong>, even if all 3x edges (2x jambs + 1x corner) aren’t perfectly aligned.</p>

<p>When such gaps exceed Topolys’ built-in tolerances (e.g. 25 mm), TBD considers (in this case) a nearby <em>sub surface</em> edge (along a corner) as a fenestration “jamb” edge, even though a 25 mm gap between <em>sub</em> and host surface edges makes little sense from a construction perspective. However, such gaps do occur as modelling artefacts in either legacy OpenStudio models, or in those imported from 3rd-party applications. To accommodate such cases, TBD provides users a <em>sub surface</em> <strong>proximity tolerance</strong> (see <a href="./settings.html" title="TBD settings">menu options</a>). If, for instance, a user sets a <em>proximity tolerance</em> of 50 mm (or rather 0.050 m), TBD ignores the aforementioned 25 mm gap and sets the 2x nearby <em>sub surface</em> corner edges as (mild) “transitions” (illustrated in blue in <strong>Figure 2B</strong>).</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/corner1.png" alt="Corner Windows" title="Corner Windows" /></p>

<p>There is little difference when <em>derating</em> both host wall surfaces (from fenestration perimeters alone) in either figures 2A or 2B. However, there remains additional heat loss from the corner edge in Figure 2B, which continues to span the full height of both host walls. This can be corrected by adding 2x vertices along the corner edge in OpenStudio or by adjusting the corner <em>psi</em> factor in TBD - practical, but additional steps nonetheless.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/corner2.png" alt="Near corner windows" title="Near corner windows" /></p>

<p>TBD matches edges this way by comparing <em>origin</em> and <em>terminal</em> vertices of any pair of <em>nearby</em> edges. TBD does not apply a <em>proximity tolerance</em> when <em>sub surface</em> edges are mismatched as in <strong>Figure 3A</strong>. This can be corrected in OpenStudio by either splitting the larger window as two smaller (yet aligned) windows (which adds a new horizontal “transition” edge in blue, shown in <strong>Figure 3B</strong>) and/or by adding corner vertices.</p>

<h3 id="multipliers">Multipliers</h3>

<p>Similar to the use of space multipliers (a proxy for story multipliers), discussed under <a href="./settings.html" title="TBD settings">tagging rules</a>, OpenStudio allows users to add fenestration multipliers. For instance, a single OpenStudio window (with <strong>10x</strong> as a multiplier) will take less time to simulate then 10x windows. No doubt a practical feature, yet caution is warranted as it disables a number of options and casts doubt on solar and daylighting distribution within spaces. TBD processes perimeter fenestration edges (as thermal bridges), regardless of multipliers. It remains up to users to determine the pros and cons of relying on <em>sub surface</em> multipliers in their OpenStudio models.</p>
