          <h3 id="fenestration">Fenestration</h3>

<p>There are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to fenestration. Within the scope of this Guide, we consider as <em>fenestration</em> all <em>sub surfaces</em> (a technical term in OpenStudio) that are added to opaque, above-grade <em>host</em> surfaces like walls, roofs or exposed floors. This includes of course windows and skylights, but in this context also <em>unglazed</em> products like roof hatches and opaque doors. TBD is unconcerned with the nature of individual fenestration products <em>per se</em>, but rather the <strong>rough opening</strong> (in the host surface) required to harbour each fenestration product. Each <em>rough opening</em> typically requires additional framing along “<strong>sill</strong>”, “<strong>head</strong>” and “<strong>jamb</strong>” edges, with corresponding “<strong>fenestration</strong>” <em>psi</em> factors.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1A</strong> illustrates a residential entrance, complete with glazed door, (partial height) left and right sidelights, as well as a 3-section transom spanning the full width of the <em>rough opening</em>.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/entrance.png" alt="Entrance" title="Entrance" /></p>

<p>In OpenStudio, this 5-section entrance would be greatly simplified, and modelled as shown in <strong>Figure 1B</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Unless modelling a <em>tubular daylighting device</em> (<a href="https://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/22-2/input-output-reference/group-daylighting.html#daylightingdevicetubular" title="Tubular Daylighting Device">TDD</a>), a fenestrated surface must <em>align</em> with its host surface, i.e. they both must share the same 3D plane equation and the <em>sub surface</em> must <em>fit</em> within host surface boundaries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>TBD tags fenestration perimeter edges (shared with its host surface) as either “<strong>head</strong>”, “<strong>sill</strong>” or “<strong>jamb</strong>” (depending on the situation, the door “sill” edge may later be overridden as a “grade” or “rimjoist” edge).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“head”, “sill” and “jamb” (as well as “grade” or “rimjoist”) edges generally constitute major thermal bridges, <em>derating</em> the host wall (never the <em>sub surface</em>). Compact fenestration (e.g. modest <em>sub surface</em> perimeter-to-area ratios) minimizes thermal bridging of the host wall construction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>TBD tags <em>shared</em> edges <strong>between</strong> <em>sub surfaces</em> (highlighted in blue) as (mild) “<strong>transitions</strong>” - by default, no <em>derating</em> results from such edges. It is presumed that any additional heat loss from fenestration framing (shared between <em>sub surfaces</em> or along perimeter edges) would be factored in e.g. the NFRC-rated fenestration U-factor.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="frame--dividers">Frame &amp; Dividers</h3>

<p>OpenStudio (and EnergyPlus) users can optionally associate <a href="https://bigladdersoftware.com/epx/docs/22-2/input-output-reference/group-thermal-zone-description-geometry.html#windowpropertyframeanddivider" title="OpenStudio Frame and Dividers">frame &amp; divider</a> properties to most glazed <em>sub surfaces</em>. In a nutshell, this allows fenestration product frames (and dividers) to be modelled/simulated separately from glazing layers, in line with NFRC 100 rating procedures. This allows <em>inter alia</em> a more robust assessment of fenestration aspect ratios on energy performance (e.g. 1x larger fenestration product outperforming many narrower, smaller products). OpenStudio fenestration, with <em>frame &amp; divider</em> properties, requires 3D modelling of the glazing portion ONLY of each <em>sub surface</em> - not the <em>rough opening</em>, as illustrated in <strong>Figure 1C</strong> (same entrance design).</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/FD.png" alt="OpenStudio Frame &amp; Dividers" title="OpenStudio Frame &amp; Dividers" /></p>

<p>TBD recognizes added <em>frame and divider</em> properties in an OpenStudio model, and feeds Topolys <strong>offset</strong> <em>sub surface</em> vertices, as illustrated in <strong>Figure 1D</strong>. By relying on offset <em>sub surface</em> vertices, “head”, “sill” and “jamb” edges remain the same as in Figure 1B. This is also the case for “transition” edges shared between <em>sub surfaces</em> (highlighted in blue). So added <em>frame and divider</em> properties will not generate issues for TBD. Note however that TBD will catch (and <a href="./reports.html" title="What TBD reports back">log</a>) invalid OpenStudio <em>frame &amp; divider</em> inputs that generate conflicts with either host surface boundaries or with other <em>sub surfaces</em>.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/FD2.png" alt="TBD Frame &amp; Dividers" title="TBD Frame &amp; Dividers" /></p>

<p><em>Frame &amp; divider</em> properties also allow outside and inside <strong>reveals</strong> (i.e. <em>sub surface</em> setbacks with respect to exterior and/or interior surfaces), as illustrated in Figure 1A. In such cases, TBD considers “head”, “sill” and/or “jamb” <em>psi</em> factors to account for the effect of <em>reveals</em>.</p>

<h3 id="proximity-tolerances">Proximity tolerances</h3>

<p>A shared edge between two <em>sub surfaces</em> at a corner (e.g. the single vertical edge highlighted in blue in <strong>Figure 2A</strong>) is also tagged by TBD as a (mild) “transition”. Again, any additional heat loss resulting from <em>corner mullions</em> should preferably be factored in NFRC fenestration rating procedures, and thus shouldn’t <em>derate</em> host wall constructions.</p>

<p>In Figure 2A, Topolys <em>breaks</em> its own copy of the original, full wall-height OpenStudio corner edge into 3x distinct, vertically-aligned segments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1x “transition” edge, shared <strong>between</strong> both windows (in blue)</li>
  <li>1x “corner” edge <strong>above</strong> both windows</li>
  <li>1x “corner” edge <strong>below</strong> both windows</li>
</ul>

<p>By default, any <em>sub surface</em> edge defined within 10 mm of another <em>sub surface</em> edge (or a host surface edge, e.g. a corner) is <em>merged</em> in Topolys as a single, shared edge. If gaps between the corner edge (highlighted in red in <strong>Figure 2B</strong>) and both <em>nearby</em> window jambs (on either side, highlighted in blue) are 10 mm wide in OpenStudio, then all 3x <em>nearby</em> edges (1x <em>broken</em> corner segment + 2x jambs) would be modelled in Topolys as a single edge (as in Figure 2A). There is no difference between the application of Topolys’ built-in tolerances and what’s illustrated in Figure 2A, even if all 3x edges aren’t perfectly aligned in the OpenStudio model (as in Figure 2B).</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/corner1.png" alt="Corner Windows" title="Corner Windows" /></p>

<p>When such gaps exceed Topolys’ built-in tolerances (e.g. 25 mm in Figure 2B), TBD instead considers a nearby <em>sub surface</em> edge (e.g. along a corner) as a fenestration “jamb” edge, even though a 25 mm gap between jamb and corner edges makes little sense from a construction perspective. Such gaps often occur as modelling artefacts (often inadvertently) in either legacy OpenStudio models or in those imported from 3rd-party applications. This automated switch, from (mild) “transition” to “jamb” edge types, necessarily means more heat loss from thermal bridging (vs Figure 2A). TBD provides users a <em>sub surface</em> <strong>proximity tolerance</strong> (see <a href="./settings.html" title="TBD settings">menu options</a>) as an optional means to override this default behaviour. If, for instance, a user sets a <em>proximity tolerance</em> of 50 mm (or rather 0.050 m), TBD ignores the aforementioned 25 mm gaps and sets the 2x <em>sub surface</em> jamb edges near the corner as (mild) “transitions” (both edges highlighted in blue in Figure 2B).</p>

<p>There is no difference when <em>derating</em> host wall surfaces, from fenestration perimeters alone, in either figures 2A or 2B. However, the <em>proximity tolerance</em> does not reset the corner edge (in red in Figure 2B) as a (mild) “transition”. The corner edge continues uninterrupted, spanning the full wall height - one should expect additional heat loss from the “corner” edge in Figure 2B (vs Figure 2A). This can be corrected by adjusting the “corner” <em>psi</em> factor in TBD - a practical tweak, yet somewhat finicky.</p>

<p>TBD matches edges this way by comparing <em>origin</em> and <em>terminal</em> vertices of any pair of <em>nearby</em> edges. TBD does not apply a <em>proximity tolerance</em> when <em>sub surface</em> edges are mismatched as in <strong>Figure 3A</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/corner2.png" alt="Near corner windows" title="Near corner windows" /></p>

<p>This can be corrected in OpenStudio by splitting for instance the larger window into two smaller (yet <em>aligned</em>) windows (which adds a new horizontal “transition” edge in blue, shown in <strong>Figure 3B</strong>). If the gaps between both <em>upper</em> window jambs and corner edge are within the user-set <em>proximity tolerance</em>, then both <em>nearby</em> window jambs will also be reset as (mild) “transitions” (both vertical edges are highlighted in blue in Figure 3B). Note that the corner edge continues uninterrupted, spanning the full wall height (in red in both figures 3A and 3B, just as in Figure 2B).</p>

<h3 id="multipliers">Multipliers</h3>

<p>Similar to the use of space multipliers (a proxy for story multipliers), discussed under <a href="./settings.html" title="TBD settings">tagging rules</a>, OpenStudio allows users to enable fenestration multipliers. For instance, a single OpenStudio window (with <strong>10x</strong> as a multiplier) will take less time to simulate then 10x windows. No doubt a practical feature, yet caution is warranted as it disables a number of options and casts doubt on solar and daylighting distribution within spaces. Regardless, TBD will process perimeter fenestration edges (as thermal bridges), while taking into consideration fenestration multipliers, e.g.</p>

<ul>
  <li>10x window “sill” thermal bridges</li>
  <li>10x window “head” thermal bridges</li>
  <li>20x window “jamb” thermal bridges</li>
</ul>

<p>… when a single OpenStudio window is defined with 10x as a multiplier. Weighing the pros and cons of using <em>sub surface</em> multipliers in OpenStudio would not be contingent on using TBD.</p>
