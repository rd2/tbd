### UA'

Many building energy codes offer traditional _prescriptive_ paths, as well as simulation-based _performance_ paths, as means to comply. _Trade-off_ paths are intermediates, where compliance can be assessed for a particular sub-domain like building envelope or interior lighting.

Common intermediate solutions for building envelopes (at least in North America) are _UA_ trade-offs, whereby one or more _non-compliant_ envelope components (e.g. spandrel panels) may be compensated by one or more _improved_ components (e.g. roof insulation). Traditionally, _UA_ trade-offs are based on _total envelope heat loss_ (in W/K), as supported for instance by [REScheck](https://www.energycodes.gov/rescheck):

```
UA = ∑ (Uo • A)
```
... where:

__Uo__ : _clear field_ transmittance  
__A__ : opaque surface area  

If the total _UA_ of a _proposed_ envelope design is equal or inferior to the corresponding total _UA_ of a _reference_ model (complying to prescriptive requirements), then the proposed design complies. This simplified approach is considered suitable for cold climates, as long as one operates within a well-defined scope:  

- UA is power-based (W), instantaneous
- time-delayed responses are not factored-in ...
- ... so forget thermal mass, ground heat loss, solar, etc.
- fenestration U-factors may be considered ...
- ... as long as _proposed_ vs _reference_ fenestration areas remain equal

### _Major_ thermal bridging

Québec's energy code (Section 3.3) expands on the concept by including _major_ thermal bridges in the mix:
```
UA' = ∑ (Uo • A) + ∑ (psi • L) + ∑ (khi • n)
```
... where:

__psi__ : linear _edge_ transmittance  
__L__ : length of the _edge_  
__khi__ : e.g. column _point_ transmittance  
__n__ : number of similar columns  

If the proposed total _UA'_ is equal or inferior to the reference total _UA'_, then the proposed design complies.

### UA' menu options

TBD automatically processes what's required (inputs) to carry out _UA'_ assessments, as well as what's often needed to demonstrate compliance (outputs) for code authorities (see [TBD menu options](./settings.html "TBD settings")):

__UA'__: checkbox enabling UA' assessments  
__UA' reference__: vs which prescriptive ruleset?

The __UA' reference__ pull-down options correspond to TBD's __Default thermal bridge sets__. If the "code (Quebec)" option is selected, then the reference prescriptive requirements include code-required _Uo_ factors, in addition to code-required _psi_ & _khi_ factors (see [Where does one get psi data?](./settings.html "TBD settings")). For all other UA' references, only the _psi_ & _khi_ factors differ between _proposed_ vs _reference_ cases. It's best to generate UA' assessments under the [Apply Measures Now](./launch.html "Launching TBD as a process") mode, while UNCHECKing the __Alter OpenStudio model__ option.

Note that _UA'_ calculations will consider [uprated](./ut.html "Uprating") assemblies, if selected.

### Assessments

In addition to standard TBD feedback (see [Reporting](./reports.html "What TBD reports back")), _UA'_ assessments pop up in the _OpenStudio Application_ runner messages, in the autogenerated _tbd.out.json_ file, and in dedicated _UA'_ reports (.md files, in both French and English):  

![UA Assessment](../assets/images/UA.png "UA Assessment")

The __Summary__ is the key output to scrutinize. For both _heated_ and _semi-heated_ sections (if applicable), _UA'_ totals (in W/K) give a sense of how close (or far) one is to reaching selected targets. Here (a hypothetical warehouse variant), the proposed design is considerably off the mark for both _heated_ and _semi-heated_ sections. Results are further broken down into individual envelope components, such as walls, roofs, doors, windows, etc., and applicable thermal bridges (e.g. "trim" for all fenestration, door and skylight perimeters). This allows one to assess the relative impact of each item, what to fix, etc.

TBD does not report on elements that are not part of the building envelope. In this warehouse example, the _heated_ section is limited to a ground floor office - its ceiling connected to a _semi-heated_ storage space above. As the office ceiling is not a roof _per se_ i.e., not part of the building envelope, TBD only reports on the _semi-heated_ roof surfaces. Similarly, only thermal bridges identified by TBD in the OpenStudio model are part of the assessment, e.g. no balconies in the warehouse.

The _UA'_ assessments are [MD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)-formatted, which can be rendered as HTML or even PDF, depending on the text editor or web browser.
